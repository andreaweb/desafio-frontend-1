		<h3>Sobre</h3>
	  	<p>And lo, led by the valiant hero Angus McFife XIII
		The forces of justice assembled their armies in the skies above Mars
		In preparation for the epic battle against the demon horde
		But on planet Earth, a far more sinister machination was afoot
		In the dwarven caverns beneath the mighty citadel of Dundee
		The evil wizard Zargothrax began to recite the dread incantation
		Which would unlock the Chaos Portal to the galactic nexus
		As foretold in the dark prophecy of Anstruther countless centuries ago
		As he placed the goblin king's crystal key into the altar before him
		Ancient runes began to glow on the surface of the portal
		Soon the gateway would open and the elder god Korviliath
		Of the eighteenth hell dimension would be unleashed onto the galaxy
		The countdown to universal annihilation had begun</p>

		<p>Warriors of planet Earth, hear my raging cry
		For mighty Dundee, the demons will die</p>

		<p>Yes, battle cruisers
		To space we'll go
		Discover new worlds
		And conquer galaxies</p>

		<p>Across the skies of Mars, the demon wars begin
		Trust in your sword, this battle we'll win
		The space knights of Crail are first to the fight
		Clashing with lasers and power of might</p>

		<p>Fly high through apocalypse skies
		Fight for the world we must save
		Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
		Chaos will triumph this day
		Apocalypse 1992</p>

		<p>At the speed of light the dwarven king arrives
		With crystal laser battleaxe into the fight he rides</p>

		<p>Pathetic dwarves
		You are no match for my demon hordes
		Let battle commence</p>

		<p>It's the rage, the cosmic rage
		The cosmic rage of astral dwarves from Aberdeen
		From their mines they will arise and fight
		The rage of the dwarves is tonight</p>

		<p>It's the rage, the cosmic rage
		The cosmic rage of astral dwarves from Aberdeen
		From their mines they will arise and fight
		The rage of the dwarves is tonight</p>

		<p>My ancestral demon army
		Will ride a cosmic sphere
		And liberate the multiverse
		From slavery and fear
		With the power of the crystal
		From an ancient galaxy
		The force of evil will prevail
		It is my destiny</p>

		<p>Fly high through apocalypse skies
		Fight for the world we must save
		Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
		Chaos will triumph this day</p>

		<p>Fly high through apocalypse skies
		Fight for the world we must save
		Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
		Chaos will triumph this day
		Apocalypse 1992</p>

		<p>From the caves beneath Dundee
		Ancient hermit arrives
		A messenger to the war in the stars
		Korviliath is nigh</p>

		<p>Deep inside the Hootsman there lies a secret heart
		Barbarian is a cyborg powered by a neutron star
		For centuries immortal he will quest in time and space
		But now he must make sacrifice to save the human race</p>

		<p>The only way to save the galaxy
		Is to destroy planet Earth and Aberdeen</p>

		<p>Faster than a laser bullet
		Hootsman flies to Fife
		He detonates his neutron heart
		Destroys all human life</p>

		<p>Fly high through apocalypse skies
		Fight for the world we must save
		Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
		Chaos will triumph this day</p>

		<p>Fly high through apocalypse skies
		Fight for the world we must save
		Like tears of a unicorn lost in the rain
		Chaos will triumph this day
		Apocalypse 1992</p>

		<p>With a thunderous implosion the Earth was vaporised
		Tearing a dimensional rift in the heavens
		Using his last chance of power
		Zargothrax plunged through the space portal
		Vanishing into another reality
		And so Angus McFife XIII followed him into the wormhole
		For the eternal glory of Dundee</p>

		</p>Sanctus!
		Dominus!</p>
